# Traffic Volume Prediction using Memory Based Recurrent Neural Networks
### Instruction to run the project
- clone the repository: 
	- git clone git@github.com:lokesh-c-das/TrafficVolumePrediction.git
- cd TVP_HPC_128_64_32_16 or cd TVP_HPC_256_128_64_32
- run any file you want, Example: python or python3 TVP_LSTM_GRU_6.py
- Every run will save results in the respective folders. Dataset is provided within the project.

Note: we have a total of 8 file to run using 2 neural network settings and 2 differnt length of past obaservations(6 hours of past observations and 24 hours of observations) with all features and reduced set of features.
